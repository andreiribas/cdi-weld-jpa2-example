=====================

Example application showing the integration between CDI Java Specification (using Weld provider) with JPA2 ORM (eclipselink). Both libraries are the default for Glassfish 3/4.x. It`s an application with only one entity class, and a Junit test class, receiving the objects via dependency injection with CDI annotations.
